Please upload your brand icon PNG files into this folder.

- Name the files after the brand name in **lowercase**.
- Replace spaces and special characters with hyphens (`-`).
- The file extension should be `.png`.

For example:
- A brand named "Coronation" should have an icon named `coronation.png`.
- A brand named "Standard Fire Works" should have an icon named `standard-fire-works.png`.

If an icon is not found for a specific brand, a default placeholder icon will be displayed.
